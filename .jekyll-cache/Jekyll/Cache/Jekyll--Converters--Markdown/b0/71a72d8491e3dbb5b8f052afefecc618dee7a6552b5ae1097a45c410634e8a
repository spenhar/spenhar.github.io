<p>In an effort to calm and collect ourselves for the road ahead, Taylor suggested we host a concert this Sunday evening because she â€œthought people could use some soothing Spen voice.â€ So, weâ€™re doing that. Iâ€™m going to prepare some songs to sing - some of my favorites, some that Iâ€™ve written, some that Iâ€™m writing this week, perhaps some that we can all sing along to.</p>
