I"€<p>Today today today. First Monday in NYC. I started my week long experiment of writing for an hour everyday. No constraints as to what should come out - a song, prose, or babbling nonsense and self loathing. I did a lot of writing in my new red journal. I wrote about it being the first Monday in NYC and how I seem to be somewhat obsessed with â€˜firstsâ€™ and new things because I can hype them up as times when I will change something about myself and be better and maybe even become the person I think I should/can/want to be.</p>

<p>The question is, why do I want to write in a book and write here on this as well? Iâ€™m not sure. Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s a point or even a purpose. Iâ€™ve been doubting if writing out every day is actually helpful to me in any way at all. But the experiment Iâ€™d like to try is, write everyday. Get practiced. I have a hope it will help me improve my self-understanding and ability to focus on one train of thought, as well as eventually progressing my self-actualization.</p>

<p>In short, setting small goals and sticking to them not sure of the outcome will be good for me.</p>

<p>Good night, Cletus.</p>
