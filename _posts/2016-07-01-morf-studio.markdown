Morf Studio: The concept, the beginning. Alex and I had met when I was working for The Experiment. He was brought in on a project we were working on that ended up winning a bajillion awards. So we decided to rent a mini shed, hustle some of our own clients, And get to it.
We found we had so much in common regarding design, product, digital etc.

It just made sense to open up our own shop. I got fired from the grid, it was time!
