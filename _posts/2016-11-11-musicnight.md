##### WHAT
In an effort to calm and collect ourselves for the road ahead, Taylor suggested we host a concert this Sunday evening because she "thought people could use some soothing Spen voice." So, we're doing that. I'm going to prepare some songs to sing - some of my favorites, some that I've written, some that I'm writing this week, perhaps some that we can all sing along to.

##### WHEN
Sunday {{ page.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}{% if page.time %} • {{ page.time }}{% endif %}{% if page.add_to_cal %} • {{ page.add_to_cal }}{% endif %}

{% if page.address %}
##### WHERE
At the {{ page.address }} in Carrboro. {% endif %}
Our place is 503C Oak Ave, which is the little grey cottage with a red door to the right and behind 503 Oak Ave (the house on the linked map). Parking is a bit confusing if you've never been before but we'll help direct. Carpool or unicycle if possible.

##### REFRESHMENTS
We'll provide various flavors of popped corn and seasonal cider. Required: bring your heart and that face we love so much. Optional: bring drinks and/or something snacky to share and/or firewood for the firepit.

XOXO

Spencer & Taylor
